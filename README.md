### Introduction

Hi there! :wave:

I am a University student who is studying Computer Science. I love coding :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: and I love JavaScript very much. So I am looking forward to contribute to your next JavaScript Project!

Fun fact: I am from :hong_kong:!

### My Goal

I am familiar with Node.js and Vue. I am currently learning Deno, React and React Native.

### Projects
I am doing [this](https://github.com/users/jswildcards/projects/1) for my final year project. Also, [Minesweeper](https://jswildcards.github.io/side-projects/minesweeper) is implementing :hammer: in my github pages too.
